This repo contains a Datatable that can render a filterable and sortable table. It aims to be very lightweight and easy to use. It has support for retrieving data asynchronously, pagination and recursive searching in relations.

## Note
Users who want to use the older version of this package, go to the [early version repo](https://github.com/ACFBentveld/Laravel-datatables). The ACFBentveld group is transferd to a new group called SingleQuote.

## Installation

## Whats new

## Let's start
